# Pangsworth Info Butler: *At your service anywhere in Madrigal.*

### Pangsworth Info Butler Web Extension
Pangsworth is an open source web extension that extends the Flyff Universe game data and makes it available for viewing in the browser. It uses caching techniques to optimally store and index *all* of the game data for quick in-memory access to game information.

This project aims to provide useful tools that are quick and easy to access while you play, right in the browser.

Pangsworth is an ambitious community project in active development with big plans for the future. Make sure to check back for updates on what's coming in later releases!

### Current features of this app
- Full local caching of API game data and image assets (just under 60MB for all data)
- Virtualized data grids for quick page-less scrolling through all game data
  - Powered by AG Data Grid community edition with out of the box features like smooth column resizing, filtering, and sorting
- User interface/experience powered by React and MUI 4.0 for a clean look and feel, dark mode included! :)
- Game object inspector featured with breadcrumbs for seamless exploration of game data
- Local Lucine-based, in-memory, real-time, full-text searching across all game data, enabling performant look ups of custom keywords
- Sophisticated implementation for background loading of API data with built in retry and rate limiting for optimal loading
- API data encapsulation providing ORM-like core APIs to make it easy to access game data locally
  - Singleton "Pang Context" design provides access to all data interfaces in all child components
