# Privacy and Usage Policy of Pangsworth Info Butler

### Zero PII Policy
Pangsworth has a zero user data policy. This means no user data is collected at any point during the usage of the extension.

### Usage of External Services
Pangsworth depends on the Flyff Universe API service provided by Gala Corp. Assets and game data used in the extension are provided by Gala, and are used purely for displaying information about the game in a useful way.

### Caching and Storage requirements
Pangsworth caches most of all of the data it fetches from the Flyff Universe API. Exceptions are made for data that become stale over a short time, e.g., API version numbers. As a result of all the caching, the extension may require significant storage space. Be aware that a minimum of 70MB is required to cache all of the game data. This does not include the total size of the extension installation which includes all source code and graphic static assets.

### Security
Pangsworth aims to maintain a small dependency tree to simplify security compliance. Common security vulnerability scanners are used regularly to identify existing vulnerabilities. Patching of identified vulnerabilities are prioritized and should be addressed within the specified grace period(s) for the respective CVE reports. The community is encouraged to raise new tickets related to security as soon as they are identified.

### Transparency
Pangsworth aims to provide **full** transparency of every aspect of the application. For any questions regarding transparency, or if an issue exists related to what the application is doing, feel free to contact the author directly at <oliveira.rlde@gmail.com>.

### Changes to this policy
Pangsworth is an ambitious community driven project in active development, with big plans for the future. New features worked on and implemented in the future may require amendments to this policy. If major amendments are made as a result, a notice will be placed on the project README. With that said, the following are considered core values that will always be honored, and **never** amended:
  - Zero user data
  - Full transparency
